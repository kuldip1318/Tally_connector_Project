Tally Connector Project
Project Description:

The Tally Connector is an application designed to seamlessly integrate with Tally ERP software to fetch and synchronize data from Tally to a database. The primary objective of this project is to automate the process of data retrieval from Tally and save it into a structured database, allowing businesses to analyze, manipulate, and process their Tally data for reporting and decision-making purposes.

Features:

Connects to Tally ERP: The application establishes a connection to Tally ERP using Tally's API or ODBC interface.

Fetches Data: Retrieves relevant data such as transactions, ledgers, vouchers, stock, and other key information directly from Tally.

Database Integration: Once data is fetched from Tally, it is automatically stored in a structured database for easy querying and reporting.

Data Synchronization: Regularly syncs the data to ensure that the latest updates from Tally are reflected in the database.

Customizable Configuration: Allows users to configure data fetching intervals and specify which Tally data to retrieve.

Error Handling: Includes built-in error handling and logging to ensure smooth data fetching and processing.

Technologies Used:

Tally ERP (API/ODBC)

Database: (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)

Programming Language: (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java, etc.)

Libraries/Frameworks: (e.g., Tally Connector SDK, Flask, Express, etc.)
